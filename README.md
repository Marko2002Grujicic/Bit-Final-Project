Interview Reports is a web application for viewing and managing candidate reports. The application was built using React and the project setup was created using create-react-app.

### The common funtionalities are:

- The user can see all the candidates available in database and their information
- The user can navigate to a single candidate report page where reports from a single candidate can be viewed by clicking on the candidate card.
- Clicking on eye icon on single candidate report page will open a modal that will provide detailed report info.
- The user can search candidates by name.
- The user can see and use Administrative Panel Application consisting of a Report List and a Submit Report page.
- The user has an option to delete a report by clicking the 'delete' icon on the report item.
- The user can go trough report wizard to create new reports by clicking the "+" button.

I'm using Interviews-Reports Api to get candidate information.
